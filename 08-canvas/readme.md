* [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38352698/mousemove-event-not-triggering-in-chrome) I couldn't get the mouse events to log without "If you are using Chrome's developer tools and have the Device Toolbar toggled on, the console will not log the mousemove events if the console is open. If you close the console while the Device Toolbar is toggled on and move your mouse, the mousemove events will log. If you toggle the Device Toobar off, you should see the events logging in the console. The shortcut for toggling the Device Toolbar on a Windows PC is `Control + Shift + M`. "
